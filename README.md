# Django server for the data science project

## Start the Django Server
For running WebApps the server need to be started (default port 8000):
```shell
python3 manage.py runserver 141.59.29.115:8000
```
Unfortunately the server runs only as long as the terminal is open. 
But by using `screen` the django server can run 24/7.
